----
go build main.go
----

== How to Test

After building execute the following command in the root folder of the project:

[source,bash]
----
go test -cover jolyons123/mm-benchmark/matrix
----

== How to Run

By running the built executable in your shell it will perform a benchmark with default parameters. In order learn the parameters run the program with the `-h` argument which will display usage.
